# Object Similarity Calculator

This Project find the similarity between any 2 Objects, examples are `Similarity between Father and Mother`, `Similarity between Paris and Italy`. This project is made only to signify that how **NLP** is used to find the **Contextually Similar Objects** in an Object Space. Although there isn't any specific usage of any dedicated NLP Library or Concept but the main idea behind this project was to see _how does NLP finds similarity between any 2 Objects on the basis of their Characteristics_.

 For Example, the Similarity between Father and Mother was found to be around 80% because both of them are Living Beings and also belogs to the category of Human Beings but their Genders are different.
